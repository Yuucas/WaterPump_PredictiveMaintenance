# Predictive Maintenance for Water Pumps

This repository contains code and resources for a predictive maintenance project focused on water pumps. The goal is to predict pump failures before they happen using sensor data.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the "Pump Sensor Data" from Kaggle. [1]

*   **Source:** [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nphantawee/pump-sensor-data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nphantawee/pump-sensor-data) [1]
*   **Description:** This dataset contains time-series data from 52 sensors installed on a water pump. The data includes sensor readings and the operational status of the pump, indicating normal operation or failure. [1]

### File Information

*   **`sensor.csv`**: This is the main data file (124.06 MB). [1]
    *   It contains three main groups of data:
        *   **Timestamp data**: Marks the time of each reading.
        *   **Sensor data (52 series)**: Raw values from 52 different sensors.
        *   **Machine status**: This is the target label, indicating the pump's operational status (e.g., NORMAL, BROKEN, RECOVERING). This will be used to predict failures. [1]

### Data Columns (Features)

The dataset includes the following columns:

*   **`timestamp`**: The date and time of the sensor reading.
*   **`sensor_00` through `sensor_51`**: These 52 columns represent the readings from the different sensors. The values are raw sensor readings. [1]
*   **`machine_status`**: This column indicates the status of the water pump at the time of the reading. This is the target variable for predictive maintenance models. [1]
    *   Possible values might include:
        *   NORMAL: The pump is operating correctly.
        *   BROKEN: The pump has failed.
        *   RECOVERING: The pump is in a recovery state after a failure (this status might need careful handling or could be merged with 'BROKEN' or excluded depending on the modeling approach).

*(Based on typical predictive maintenance datasets and the description, the exact values for `machine_status` might vary. It's crucial to explore the unique values in this column during data preprocessing.)*

### Context and Motivation

The dataset was provided by a team managing water pumps in a small area that experienced multiple system failures, causing significant problems for the local population. The aim is to leverage this sensor data to identify patterns that precede failures, enabling proactive maintenance and preventing future disruptions. [1]

## Project Goal

The primary goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can predict impending water pump failures based on the sensor data. This involves:

1.  **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Understanding the data, identifying patterns, and visualizing sensor trends.
2.  **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaning the data, handling missing values, feature engineering, and preparing it for model training. This might include handling the time-series nature of the data.
3.  **Model Development:** Training and evaluating various classification or time-series forecasting models to predict the `machine_status`.
4.  **Deployment (Optional):** Creating a system that can use the trained model to monitor new sensor data and raise alerts for potential failures.

## Potential Use Cases

*   **Predictive Maintenance:** The core use case is to predict when a pump is likely to fail, allowing for maintenance to be scheduled before a breakdown occurs. This minimizes downtime and reduces the impact of failures.
*   **Anomaly Detection:** Identifying unusual sensor readings that might indicate an early-stage fault or a deviation from normal operating conditions.
*   **Root Cause Analysis:** Although not the primary goal, analyzing sensor data leading up to failures might provide insights into the common causes of pump malfunctions.
